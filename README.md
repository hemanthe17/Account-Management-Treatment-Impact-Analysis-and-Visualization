# Account-Management-Treatment-Impact-Analysis-and-Visualization

Executed a thorough risk management analysis for Fleetcor, meticulously evaluating the impact of diverse credit treatments 
(e.g., credit line reductions, term tightening) on over 10,000 high-risk customers, which informed actionable strategies to 
minimize credit losses by an estimated 10% ($1.5M annually). 
Conducted a detailed write-off savings analysis, comparing retro loss against actual loss across multiple product portfolios, 
successfully identifying potential savings exceeding millions of dollars ($2M+) through enhanced customer targeting and 
predictive analytics. 
Analyzed complex customer attrition trends using key metrics such as spend, gallons pumped, and revenue (pre/post
treatment) for a customer base of over 500,000, subsequently recommending data-driven retention strategies that 
improved customer lifetime value by 8%. 
Developed and deployed an interactive Power BI dashboard, visualizing treatment outcomes across 3 distinct lines of 
business, 5 key portfolios, and multiple customer segments, enabling executive-level insights and strategic decision
making for a leadership team of 10+ stakeholders. 
Engineered and validated regression, classification, and time series forecasting models utilizing Python and Azure AutoML 
Studio to accurately predict write-offs, delinquency risk, and customer attrition patterns with an average predictive 
accuracy of 92%. 
Augmented project capabilities with Google Cloud Vertex AI labs, applying BigQueryML, AutoML Vision, and Gemini 
multimodal tools to explore advanced generative AI, image classification, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
workflows for enhanced data analysis, processing over 1TB of raw data. 
Utilized SQL for robust data integration and Python for advanced statistical modelling, ensuring scalable and accurate 
analysis across large datasets exceeding 5TB.
